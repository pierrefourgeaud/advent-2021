# Day 4

This day was made with `Kotlin`. I used [IntelliJ IDEA 2021.3 (Community Edition)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) to work on the day and used then a quick way to compile and run the solution without needing it using [`kotlinc`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html#install-the-compiler).

## Run

```bash
kotlinc main.kt -include-runtime -d main.jar
java -jar main.jar ./input.txt
```
