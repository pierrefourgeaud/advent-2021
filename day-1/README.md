# Day 1

This day was made in `Assembly Intel x86 Linux`. There is a lot of boilerplate code but the solution is rather simple. I tried to document it as much as possible.

## Run

```
make run asm=main.S input=input.txt
```

**_Note: If you want to use the example file or any other input file, you need to modify `main.S` on line 18._**

**_Note 2: The input file requires an empty line at the end of file._**
